# Toll-Free SMS vs. Local Numbers

Local and toll-free numbers can be used to send and receive SMS under RingCentral's High Volume SMS program.

| Number Type | Description |
|-|-|
| Local | Local Numbers have geographically assigned area codes, e.g. `650-555-0100`. These numbers may be desirable when your firm has a local presence, e.g. texting for a physical local presence to a recipient in the same geographic area. |
| Toll-Free | Toll-Free Numbers have nation-wide area codes, e.g. `800-555-0100`. These are useful for sending nation-wide when there is no need to associate the message with a specific geographic region. Toll-free numbers have one of the following area codes: 800, 888, 877, 866, 855, 844 or 833. |

Both types of numbers can be purchased in the RingCentral [Account Portal](https://service.ringcentral.com) under "Phone Numbers".

## Carrier Approval

Both local and toll-free numbers enrolled in High Volume SMS can be used to send "Non-Consumer (A2P)" SMS as described in the [CTIA Messaging Principles and Best Practices guide](https://www.ctia.org/the-wireless-industry/industry-commitments/messaging-interoperability-sms-mms).

Local numbers are enrolled in a Commercial Long Code / 10DLC program with wireless carriers that allows these number send at high volume.

## Supported Countries

Currently, High Volume SMS is supported for numbers in the United States and Canada.
