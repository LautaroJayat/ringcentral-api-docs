# High Volume SMS Best Practices and Guidelines

Spam message and invalid phone number are the most common reasons of having low message deliverability - the SMS performance which you aim to reach as high as possible.

Invalid number issues can be your mistake. E.g., sending a text message to your customer's landline number, to a mobile phone number without a country code, or simply a typo mistake etc,. It's quite easy to deal with invalid phone number problem by using phone number validation service to detect mobile phone number, or by writing a script to check the country code and number format, before sending text messages to that number.

Spam message problems can be your oversights. E.g. sending a long capitalized text message or using hyperbole like '100% GUARANTEED', 'COMPLETELY FREE' could trigger a spam filter to block your message. It's much harder to deal with spam blockage because spam filters range from keywords that prevent messages from getting through, to complex, machine-learning filters that shield recipients in real-time from being overwhelmed by unwanted messages. Often filters are activated by customer complaints, causing future messages emanating from that number to filtered out.

Different wireless carriers apply different anti-spam filtering techniques, to protect their subscribers from receiving unsolicited and harmful messages. Spam detection is messy and some carriers are stricter than others. The boundary between spam and non-spam messages is fuzzy, and the criteria may change over time.

A good rule of thumb is to put yourself in your recipientâ€™s shoes and write a message in a way that would be compelling for you.

Wireless carriers collectively evaluate the reputation of your phone number, by to determine whether to deliver messages to their subscribers.

Follows are some best practices and guidelines which would help you increase your SMS performance.

* Get permission
* Increase and maintain response rate
* Include opt-out instructions
* Segment your recipient lists
* Segment your messages
* Do not send messages to opted-out recipients
* Use Single Domain Links

* Verify recipient numbers are SMS enabled


## Get permission

Get recipient's opt-in consent before sending messages to their number. This is not only protecting your business from violating text messaging regulations may cost your business a fortune, especially for marketing or other non-essential messages.


## Increase and maintain response rate

High response rate is the good health of your interactive text messaging with your customers. It would help prevent wireless carriers from blocking your text messages. Especially, when you start using your High Volume SMS phone number for the first time, as high response rate would help warm up your phone number reputation. Start your text messaging campaign by sending a brief message to ask if your customers would like to learn more about your sale or your promo. E.g. 'Reply YES for more info'. Treat the first message as an opt-in or opt-out choice for your customers.

Avoid sending a long text message to new recipients

## Include opt-out instructions

Always provide clear opt-out instructions. Messages without opt-out instructions are likely to get marked as spam. Including opt-out instructions also ensures compliance with consumer data protection regulations. For example, add this text at the end of each message 'Text STOP to unsubscribe'. You don't need to add the opt-out instructions to every message sending to

## Segment your recipient lists

Avoid sending the same message to mass recipients. Segment your recipient lists based on customer preferences, demographics and other characteristics. Then, send relevant messages to each group to vary your content.

## Segment your messages

SMS differs from email in that the messages are very short. Do not make your SMS message an email! Sending a very long text message to mass recipients looks like spam. So, break your long message into multi-section messages, then send a brief message with response choices to receive the next messages. As a bonus, this will usually improve your response rates, too.

## Do not send messages to opted-out recipients

Regularly, read opted-out numbers and remove them from your recipient list.

Sending a text message to an opted-out recipient is violating the text messaging compliance laws, and as a consequence, a recipient's carrier will block your message. Keep sending text messages to an opted-out recipient may trigger the recipient's carrier to block your phone number permanently.


## Use Single Domain Links

If you use URLs in your message, the following are important considerations are necessary to use them successfully.

* Use links associated with a single hostname per message
* Full domains are preferred. Link shorteners can be used but use a link shortener domain that you own.

!!! warning "Avoid public / shared link shortener domains"
    Hosted link shorteners are easy to set up and use, however you should not use a public / shared link shortener domain as the same domains are often used by attackers to mask phishing and other URLs.

    If you wish to use one for text messages, check to see the service supports using your own domain, sometimes called custom domains or vanity URLs.

    Some common public / shared domain shorteners to avoid include:
    - bit.ly
    - goo.gl
    - tinyurl.com
    - Tiny.cc
    - bc.vc
    - budurl.com
    - Clicky.me
    - is.gd
    - lc.chat
    - soo.gd
    - s2r.co
