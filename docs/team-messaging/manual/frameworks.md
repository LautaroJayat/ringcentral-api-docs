# Using Bot Frameworks

Messaging is a core component of RingCentral’s communication and collaboration platform, offered as both Team Messaging (a.k.a. "Glip") and SMS. RingCentral’s APIs open up powerful ways to enhance the messaging experience by enabling conversational bot applications that can chat directly with your users.

To speed up development, in addition to the core RingCentral Team Messaging and SMS APIs, a number of RingCentral and community libraries are available to assist with creating bots and SMS listed below:
