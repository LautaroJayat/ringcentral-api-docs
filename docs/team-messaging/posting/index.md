# Methodologies for posting messages

Arguable one of the most critical functions a team messaging app can perform is the act of posting a message. Messages can be posted using one of the following methods. Choose the method that is the best for your application. 

# Posting via the REST API

To [post a message via the REST API](../posting-via-rest/) a developer composes a request to the [Post Message endpoint](https://developers.ringcentral.com/api-reference/TODO) with the message payload. This method requires the developer to know the ID of the chat they are posting to prior to sending the post request.

# Posting via an Incoming webhook

An incoming webhook is a URL generated by RingCentral to make posting messages to a specific chat much easier. They are also a common way to integrate with third-party services that have the means of performing an HTTP POST as a means of integration. No authentication is required when [posting a message via an incoming webhook URL](../webhook-posting/).

Incoming webhooks can be generated in three ways:

1. Programmatically. The Incoming webhook API can be used to create an incoming webhook associated with a given chat ID.
2. Manually. From with the RingCentral desktop client, one can select "Incoming webhook" from the Add-ons tab. 
3. Via a notification app. RingCentral will generate an incoming webhook and pass its URL to a notification app to facilitate a web-based installation flow for that app.
