For example, RingCentral Sandbox environment is accessible at `https://platform.devtest.ringcentral.com.`\nIf you are not sure which URI to use for your environment, please contact [RingCentral Technical Support](https://developers.ringcentral.com/support.html) to get proper connection settings.\n*Please note* that for security reasons connection is only allowed using HTTPS protocol to the default HTTPS port #443, so the port can be omitted in the URI.\n\n**API resources** are organized in a hierarchical manner and presented in a tree-like structure.\n**All paths** are started from `/restapi`. \n**A typical link to API resource** looks as follows: `https://platform.ringcentral.com/restapi/v1.0/account/159048008/extension/171857008/call-log?dateFrom=2017-08-26`\n*Please note* that RingCentral users associate an account with the company main phone number and an extension with the short extension number, but both *accountId* and *extensionId* are internal identifiers.\n**A typical API usage scenario** includes accessing particular resources on behalf of a user whose credentials (phone number, extension number and password) were passed on authentication phase. \nIn this case the API enables simplified syntax of specifying account and extension identifiers by the tilde symbol (~). It can be used as a replacement for both *accountId* and *extensionId* if you are going to access data that belongs to account/extension you are currently logged in to. \nFor example, if the user successfully authenticated with the account #159048008 and extension #171857008 then the URI to retrieve the call log resource may be written as follows: `https://platform.ringcentral.com/restapi/v1.0/account/~/extension/~/call-log?dateFrom=2017-08-26`.\n"},{"title":"Changelog","x-tag-group":"Using the API","description":"\n","children":[{"title":"2021

API","description":"\n","children":[{"title":"Object Representation","description":"Whenever you need to send or retrieve a particular piece of data — for example, a call log record, information on an extension, etc. — it will be embedded in the HTTP request or response.\n\nThe RingCentral API allows you to explicitly define a representation format by using the following HTTP headers.\n\n- `Content-Type` header defines the MIME type of the request body. The server will expect the request body to contain data in the specified format.\n- `Accept` header indicates desired MIME type of the response body. The server will return response data in this format (if possible) and will set the `Content-Type` response header accordingly.\n\n### Supported Representation Formats\n| Format | MIME type | HTTP request/response body example |\n| ------ | --------- | ---------------------------------- |\n| JSON   | `application/json` |<pre>`{`<br>  `\"uri\": \"https://platform.ringcentral.com/restapi/v1.0\",`<br>  `\"versionString\": \"1.0.0\",`<br>  `\"releaseDate\": \"2012-06-14T00:00:00.000Z\",`<br>  `\"uriString\": \"v1.0\",`<br>`}`</pre>|\n| HTML Form Data *(only for token request body as governed by OAuth 2.0 specification)* | `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` | `grant_type=password&username=18887776655&password=987654` |\n\nThe RingCentral API uses JSON as the default representation format. It means that if the `Accept` header is not set, the server will return results in JSON. \n\nHowever, `Content-Type` header is mandatory for all requests which have body (namely requests with `POST` and `PUT` HTTP methods). Also for such requests client is required to provide `Content-Length` header containing the length of the request body in bytes.\n\n"},{"title":"Data Types","description":"The table below describes the data types which are used in the RingCentral API.\n\n| Data Type     | Description |\n| ------------- | ----------- |\n| `string`      | General string value |\n| `enumeration` | Predefined string constants/List of predefined string constants |\n| `integer`     | 64-bit integer value |\n| `datetime`    | Timestamp in XML schema-compatible format, in accordance with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601\" target=\"_blank\">ISO 8601</a> format including timezone. <br><br> Note that **T** appears literally in the string, to indicate the beginning of the time element. <br><br>The supported formats with the examples are as follows: <br><br> Year: `YYYY` (eg 2012) <br><br> Year and month: `YYYY-MM` (eg 2012-07) <br><br> Complete date: `YYYY-MM-DD` (eg 2012-07-16) <br><br> Complete date plus hours and minutes: `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mmTZD` (eg 2012-07-16T23:12:30) <br><br> Complete date plus hours, minutes and seconds:<br><br>`YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssTZD` (eg 2012-07-16T23:12:30Z or 2012-07-16T23:12:30+04:00) <br><br> Complete date plus hours, minutes, seconds and a decimal fraction of a second: <pre>YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sTZD (eg 2012-07-16T23:12:30.45Z) </pre><br><br> **Where:** <br><br> `YYYY` = four-digit year <br> `MM`   = two-digit month (01=January, etc.) <br> `DD`   = two-digit day of month (01 through 31) <br> `hh`   = two digits of hour (00 through 23) (am/pm NOT allowed) <br> `mm`  = two digits of minute (00 through 59) <br> `ss`   = two digits of second (00 through 59) <br> `s`    = one or more digits representing a decimal fraction of a second <br> `TZD`  = time zone designator (Z or +hh:mm or -hh:mm) <br><br> The server currently processes all timestamps in UTC timezone; for example, 2012-01-01T00:15:34Z. <br><br> By default the server returns datetime format in full format, including a decimal fraction of a second YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sTZD, for example 2012-07-16T23:12:30.45Z). <br><br> Please note, that when comparing timestamps, the timestamp is truncated to a second precision. For example, the response to request where the **dateFrom** value equals to 2012-07-16T23:12:30.45Z is always identical to the one with the 'dateFrom' value 2012-07-16T23:12:30Z.\n\n"},{"title":"Phone Numbers","description":"\nThe API supports phone numbers in [e.164](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164) format with plus sign `+` complying with the [ITU-T recommendation](https://www.itu.int/dms_pub/itu-t/opb/sp/T-SP-E.164D-11-2011-PDF-E.pdf).\n```json   \n\"from\" : \n    {\n      \"phoneNumber\" : \"+16501234567\",\n      \"name\" : \"John Smith\"\n    }\n```\n\nThe phone number processing also conforms to country specific compliance requirements, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (US), the General Data Protection Regulation (EU), etc. relating to personal data protection, e.g. masking numbers in call log API, that looks as follows:\n\n```json   \n\"to\" : \n   {\n      \"phoneNumber\" : \"+1855201XXXX\",\n      \"name\" : \"Jane Williams\" \n    }\n```\n"},{"title":"Resource Identification","description":"The table below describes properties which are supported by almost all API resources and used for identification purposes.\n\n| Parameter | Type       | Description |\n| --------- | ---------- | ----------- |\n| `id`      | string     | Internal unique identifier of a resource. This property exists in all resources which support retrieval/update/delete of a single record of particular type. Depending on a resource it can hold either an integer or a string value. The resource ID is also passed as a path parameter in the URI |\n| `uri`     | URI string | Canonical URI of a resource. This URI might not be the same as the one which was used to retrieve this resource information. For example, if a resource was accessed by the URI containing simplified syntax with the tilde (~) characters, the canonical URI will also contain real identifiers. In most cases the URI contains an ID value embedded as a path parameter |\n\nThe similar convention is used when one resource refers to another. For example, a direct phone number returned by the API contains a link to the extension it is assigned to in the following property:\n\n```json\n\"extension\":\n    {\n        \"id\": 234244008,\n        \"uri\": \".../account/405884008/extension/234244008\"\n    }\n```\n\n"},{"title":"Response Format","description":"\nSince REST API is built on top of HTTP protocol, it reuses some concepts and common HTTP status codes to inform a client about a result of API method execution.\n\nThere could be the following possible response scenarios\n\n* **Successful** completion of a request. The client gets HTTP response with 2XX or 3XX status code and optionally somebody payload depending on the request. \n* **Client errors**. The server returns HTTP response with one of the 4xx status code. In most cases, the response body contains more detailed information about the reason for the issue. Such error usually means that the client does something wrong, unexpected or disallowed.\n* **Server errors**. The server returns HTTP response with one of the 5xx status code. In most cases, the response body contains more detailed information about the reason for the issue.  This kind of errors is returned in case of unexpected issues on the server side.\n* This guideline follows general patterns described here: <a href=\"http://www.restapitutorial.com/httpstatuscodes.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.restapitutorial.com/httpstatuscodes.html</a>\n\n### API Response Status Codes\n#### HTTP 2xx – Success\nMost of the HTTP 2xx status codes (200, 201, 202, 204, 206) indicate that the action requested by the client was received, understood, accepted and processed successfully.\n\n`HTTP 207 Multi-status` code can be returned for some API requests which means that response consists of multiple parts returned as a \"multipart/mixed\" body (see also [RFC 2046](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2046)). In this case, the first part of this multipart response contains JSON array with real status codes corresponding to each part of a response, see [Batch Requests](#Batch-Requests) section below.\n\n#### HTTP 3xx  – Redirection\nThis class of status code indicates the client must take additional action to complete the request. Many of these status codes are used in redirection.\n\nFor  `HTTP 301`, `HTTP 302`, `HTTP 303`, `HTTP 307` and `HTTP 308` client must support automatic redirection to new URL returned in Location header as specified in [RFC 2616](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-10.3)\n\nIf by some reason `Location` header is not returned, the client should repeat request to the same URL.\n\n`HTTP 304` – can be returned only for some API requests which allow specifying conditional headers `If-None-Match`, `If-Modified-Since`  (see also [RFC 7232](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232#page-13)). Such status is an indication that resource is not modified and the client doesn't need to update locally cached version of a resource.\n\nAPI clients have to follow the following rules when processing HTTP 3xx responses:\n* `HTTP 301`, `HTTP 302`, `HTTP 303` — request to target URL specified in Location header must be performed with `HEAD` method (if original method was `HEAD`) or `GET` method (if original method was `GET`, `PUT`, `POST` or `DELETE`)\n* `HTTP 307`, `HTTP 308` — request to target URL specified in `Location` header must be performed with the same HTTP method as the original request\n* `HTTP 304` – no additional requests to the server should be performed.\n\n#### HTTP 4xx  – Client Error\nThe 4xx class of status code is intended for cases in which the client seems to have erred. In most cases (except `HTTP 429`) request should **not** be retried in unchanged form. RingCentral API can return `HTTP 400`, `HTTP 403`, `HTTP 405`, `HTTP 406`, `HTTP 408`, `HTTP 409`, `HTTP 415` and other statuses which should be handled this way.\n\n##### HTTP 429 – Too Many Requests\nThis means that the client exceeded some quota or rate limit defined for all or for certain types of API requests. \nThe client may retry the original request after getting this HTTP code not earlier than in a number of seconds returned in `Retry-After` header (see [RFC 6585](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6585#section-4)).\n\nAdditional information about throttling limits is returned in `X-RateLimit-XXX` response headers, see [Usage Plan Groups](#Usage-Plan-Groups).\n\n##### HTTP 401 – Unauthorized\nIt means that access token provided by a client is invalid or expired. The client should request new access token and repeat the request with it. Depending on used OAuth grant type and application settings the client may have refresh token (which should be used in this situation to get new access token). In case of client credentials, implicit and some other flows the client should repeat the original method to request a fresh access token.\n\n##### HTTP 404 – Not Found\nThis status code may mean that particular URL requested is invalid, or that resource with given ID (indicated as a part of URL) does not exist or not accessible for the authorized user.\nSuch error can be usually ignored if returned as a result of `DELETE` request which means that resource was already deleted on the server (which may happen due to different server-side retention policies or concurrent requests from other API clients).\n\n#### HTTP 5xx  – Server Error\nThe server failed to fulfill an apparently valid request. The server is aware that it has encountered an error or is otherwise incapable of performing the request.\nThere can be very different reasons for the 50x status returned. The app should retry request up to 3 times, and the developer may contact RingCentral Developer Support if the problem persists.\n\n##### HTTP 503 – Service Unavailable\nThe server is currently unavailable (because it is overloaded or down for maintenance). Generally, this is a temporary state. \nIn some cases, this status indicates that server cannot handle just this particular type of requests while other can be processed.\nThe client may retry the original request after getting this HTTP code not earlier than in a number of seconds returned in `Retry-After` header (see [RFC 7231](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-7.1.3)).\n\n##### Other 5xx\nThe client should not repeat the request. RingCentral Developer Support should be informed about the problem.\n\n### Authentication/Authorization Errors\nSince RingCentral API uses OAuth 2.0 for authorization, the server behavior is mostly governed by OAuth specification.\n\n* The behavior of RingCentral API Authorization flows is defined by OAuth 2.0 Specification ([RFC 6749](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) and [RFC 6750](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750))\n* Regardless of the number of threads which send API requests to the server, the application should perform OAuth authentication in a single thread, store and share tokens to be used in all regular API requests. Backend servers enforce some quotas for the number of authorization requests and number of active application sessions. If the quota is exceeded at any given time, the server starts to return `HTTP 429` on authorization requests. \n* Application must avoid frequent authentication attempts under the same user credentials. In order to extend session after access token expiration, it has to use token refreshment flow (if allowed)\n* Application should store `expires_in` and `refresh_token_expires_in` values along with access/refresh tokens and their issue time. This value is to be used to pre-check if the token is expired or about to expire before sending regular API requests in order to refresh tokens proactively. It is strongly recommended to avoid performing refreshment basing on `HTTP 401` errors which are returned by the server.\n* According to OAuth 2.0 standard some logical error codes are returned in error field of the response.\n\n#### OAuth Authorize \nFor 3-legged OAuth flows in some cases `HTTP 400` may be returned on `/restapi/oauth/authorize` call. For example, it can happen when the client provides invalid redirect URI in the request. See [RFC 6749](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) for details.\n\n#### OAuth Token\nAs a general rule, if a request to /restapi/oauth/token API for access token fails client must NOT send other API requests until resolved. It should be properly orchestrated if client uses multiple threads which share the same tokens to send regular API requests.\n\n* `HTTP 400` – do not repeat request; if possible inform the user about failure and prompt for new credentials \n* `HTTP 429`, `HTTP 503` – retry in an indicated interval returned in Retry-After header.\n* `HTTP 4xx`, `HTTP 5xx` – do not repeat request, error in client or server code\n* `HTTP 400` – use cached credentials (if possible) to re-authenticate, or prompt user for new credentials.\n* `HTTP 408`, `HTTP 500`, client timeout – repeat 3 times with 10 seconds intervals, then try re-request tokens using cached credentials (if possible), or prompt user for new credentials (all dependent regular requests should be queued and wait for resolution)\n\n#### OAuth Revoke \nIn case of any error on the request to `/restapi/oauth/revoke` API client should just ignore it and do not retry.\n\n### Connection Errors Handling\nThere is a possibility that the Client Application is not able to establish a connection(s) with RingCentral service(s) for some reasons like \"Connection Timeout\", \"SSL Handshake Failure\" or other connection failures.\n\nThis situation might indicate problems on a backend side and it is very important to not overwhelm the backend with unnecessary client requests in this case.\n\nIn the described situation Client Application should follow an \"Exponential Backoff\" approach:\n\"The retries exponentially increase the waiting time up to a certain threshold. The idea is that if the server is down temporarily, it is not overwhelmed with requests hitting at the same time when it comes back up.\"\n\nThe following Retry Delays are recommended for Client Applications in case of any Connection Failures:\n\n2 seconds\n3 seconds\n5 seconds\n8 seconds\n13 seconds\n21 seconds\n30 seconds\n\nKeep trying to connect every 30 seconds\n\n"},{"title":"Error Codes","description":"The API uses specific error codes to make error processing for client applications more simple and effective. The body of HTTP response should be always logged and analyzed. It is sometimes impossible to understand the reason for the issue by only HTTP status code. Error code from the body should be also taken into consideration.\n\nClient app should rely on `errorCcode` and, in some cases, on additional fields like `parameterName`, not on error `message` because of it can be changed in next versions of the API and localized according to `Accept-Language` header if the language is supported by RingCentral service. Response body with error message can contain several error messages and has the following structure:\n\n```http\n{\n   \"errorCode\": \"LegacyCode\",  //legacy logical error code, deprecated. Will not be supported in later versions of API\n   \"message\": \"Error message\", //legacy error message\n   \"errors\": [\n      {\n         \"errorCode\": \"ABC-123\",     //error code\n         \"message\": \"Error message\", //error message\n         \"additionalInfo\": \"value\",  //additional attribute for this error, e.g \"parameterName\": \"extensionId\"\n      },\n      {\n         \"errorCode\": \"XYZ-321\",\n         \"message\": \"Second error message\"\n      }\n   ]\n}\n```\n\nPossible error codes for each API method are listed in method description under **Error Codes** header.\n\n### Common Error Codes\nThe following error codes potentially might be returned on any API call:\n\n| HTTP Code | Error Code | Error Message | Typical Reason |\n|-----------|------------|---------------|----------------|\n| `400`     | `CMN-101`  | Parameter [*parameterName*] value is invalid | Parameter value type is incorrect; enumeration value is unsupported; or the mandatory parameter is  missed |\n| `400`     | `CMN-104`  | Cannot parse request | Request body for POST/PUT method is empty |\n| `400`     | `CMN-406`  | Duplicate value for parameter *parameterName*: *parameterValue* found in request | Request is invalid, see the message |\n| `400`     | `CMN-407`  | Unable to parse *headerName* header value: \"*headerValue*\" |  Request header value is incorrect or unsupported |\n| `403`     | `BIL-101`  | Feature [*featureName*] is not available for current service plan | The feature is not included into the current user's account [Service Plan](https://success.ringcentral.com/articles/RC_Knowledge_Article/Billing-Service-Plan-RingCentral) |\n| `403`     | `BIL-102`  | Limit of *featureName* exceeded | Some limitation of current user's account [Service Plan](https://success.ringcentral.com/articles/RC_Knowledge_Article/Billing-Service-Plan-RingCentral) |\n| `403`     | `BIL-103`  | Feature [*featureName*] is not available for current account | The feature is turned off for the current user's account |\n| `403`     | `CMN-112`  | Feature [*featureName*] is not available for current extension type | The feature is not applicable for the current user's extension type |\n| `403`     | `CMN-113`  | Feature [*featureName*] is not available for current extension | The feature is turned off for the current user by account admin |\n| `403`     | `CMN-404`  | Attempt to access another extension | The resource belongs to another user and the current user has no access granted for the requested  user resources|\n| `403`     | `CMN-401`  | In order to call this API endpoint, application needs to have [*permissionId*] permission | App key used at authorization stage does not grant the appropriate app permission, see [Application Permissions](#Application-Permissions) |\n| `403`     | `CMN-408`  | In order to call this API endpoint, user needs to have [*permissionId*] permission for requested resource. | The current user does not have the appropriate user permission granted, see [User Permissions](#User-Permissions) |\n| `404`     | `CMN-102`  | Resource for parameter [*parameterName*] is not found | The requested resource is not found by the ID specified; the resource could be already deleted, or the access to it is denied for the current user|\n| `404`     | `CMN-120`  | Invalid URI | There is no such method in the RingCentral Connect Platform API |\n| `409`     | `CMN-204`  | Resource is blocked by another operation | Another operation changing the requested resource is already in progress |\n| `429`     | `CMN-301`  | Request rate exceeded | Too many API calls from the same user (extension) by the current application, see also [Usage Plan Groups](#Usage Plan Groups) |\n| `500`     | `CMN-203`  | Internal Server Error | The server failed to run an apparently valid request |\n| `501`     | `CMN-202`  | Operation is not available | The requested action is currently unsupported by the API |\n| `503`     | `CMN-201`  | Service Temporary Unavailable | The server is currently unavailable being overloaded or down for maintenance |\n\n"},{"title":"Batch Requests","description":"One of the commonly used REST practices is the support of batch operations to retrieve multiple homogeneous resources by their key using a single request. The RingCentral API supports batch requests for a number of endpoints, for example messages, call records, blocked numbers, presence etc. They are implemented via the methods `GET`, `DELETE` and `PUT` with all their features. Batch operations are not transaction-atomic. Each resource in a batch is processed separately from the others, making it possible to receive different success/failure results for different resources wrapped in a multipart response object. The HTTP status code `207 Multi-Status` (Multi-Status) is returned in every multipart response object and indicates a batch request.\n\n---\n**Note**\n\nThe `207 Multi-Status` code is not returned in response body in case of error accessing the endpoint. For example, if the requested endpoint does not exist at all, `404 Not Found` status code is returned. If there is a server error, `5xx` status code is returned.\nIn batch `DELETE` operations (if all resources are deleted successfully) the server returns the `204 No content` instead of multi status (since all parts would be identical in this case). In case of at least one failure the server returns the `207 Multi-Status`.\n\n---\n\nApart from the top-level special status code in case of success, a multipart response object contains status codes in each part, representing a particular requested resource. This status specifies an individual result for each requested resource out of the batch. Let's consider the examples of batch request below.\n\n**Batch request for `GET` method**\n\n*1.

Each user (extension) has one role assigned. On the API level, there might be a few roles assigned for one extension - some of them are automatically assigned according to some service plan options. Each role has a set of granted permissions. The user has a superset of permissions granted based on all the roles assigned to his/her extension (explicitly or auto-assigned).\n\nMost of the API methods have some permissions required for the API call to be successfully performed. Typically, it is one specific permission, which is mentioned under the **User Permission** header in method description in the API Reference. In case the user does not have the permission required, the error code `CMN-408` will be returned with the `HTTP 403 Forbidden` status code, see also: [Error Codes](#section-error-codes). To avoid unexpected error messages or even application crash the required permission can be checked with [Authorization Profile/Permission Check](https://developers.ringcentral.com/api-reference#Authorization-Profile) API before the target API call and the user interface properly adjusted (hiding/disabling some buttons, showing some tooltips, etc.)\n\nLearn more about RingCentral <a href=\"https://success.ringcentral.com/articles/RC_Knowledge_Article/5-10-Editing-the-Extension-Permissions-via-Web\" target=\"_blank\">Roles and Permissions</a>.\n\nSee also: <a href=\"https://ringcentral-api-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/authorization_profile/\" target=\"_blank\">Authorization Profile and Permission Invalidation</a>.\n\n"},{"title":"Usage Plan Groups","description":"\n**Usage Plan** is a scheme specifying limits of using of API resources for a client application. Appliance of usage plans ensures consistent load allocation through correct interaction with the RingCentral Connect Platform. \n**Your application Usage Plan** is available on your RC account by clicking the ‘Rate Limits‘ on ‘Apps‘ tab; it specifies the supported number of requests of each API group and the request time frame in seconds. \n**Every API method** is marked as ‘Heavy’, ‘Medium’, ‘Light’ according to their processing, or ‘Auth’ for authorization requests; this mark can be found under the *Usage Plan Group* header in method description. \n*Example:*\n![Rate Limits](https://netstorage.ringcentral.com/dpw/api-reference/images/Rate_Limits.png)\n\nWithin the above given limits, the client application is allowed to send 10 heavy, 40 medium, 50 light and 5 authorization requests per user (RC extension) per minute. When exceeded the server returns `429 Too Many Requests` HTTP error code. It means the client is throttled by the server due to high request rate. The retry period in seconds is returned in the `Retry-After` header. In case the request is resent earlier (before the period specified in `Retry-After` header is over) the penalty interval is applied. The penalty interval value for requests of each API group is displayed in the corresponding column. \n\n**Please note** that the penalty interval will be renewed until the client waits for the required time interval to pass before sending new requests. If the client is constantly sending new requests, the penalty period would keep on renewing and would never expire.\n\nThe following **Rate Limits Headers** are returned for the limited API requests:\n* `X-Rate-Limit-Group` — API group of the request (Light, Medium, Heavy, Auth)\n* `X-Rate-Limit-Limit` — the current rate limit for the request\n* `X-Rate-Limit-Remaining` — the number of requests left for the time interval (window) of this rate limit\n* `X-Rate-Limit-Window` — time interval in seconds for the request rate limit\n\n"}]},{"title":"Localization","x-tag-group":"Using the API","description":"\n","children":[{"title":"Languages Support","description":"The content returned by RingCentral API is **not** localized in most cases as assumed to be machine readable, not human readable.

If this header is omitted, incorrect or contains unsupported language code, the server returns localized content in the language which is configured in user extension regional settings (by default, `en-US` for RingCentral US and Canada accounts, `en-GB` for RingCentral UK accounts).
